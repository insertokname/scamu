//! # Implementations

//! The Addressing mode has 2 purposes:
//!
//! 1. Different addressing modes write to different things.
//! Some of them write to the bus, others to registers while
//! others don't need writing at all. This is a common abstraction
//! over the logic of writing and reading addressing modes.
//!
//! 2. Addressing modes all get displayed in different ways depending
//! on their value. The addressing mode trait provides a common interface
//!  for them
